## Create a list with function set, get, setinv and getinv for a given matrix


makeCacheMatrix <- function(x = matrix()) {

}


## Checks if there is an invers of the matrix cached if not returns it and caches it

cacheSolve <- function(x, ...) {
        ## Return a matrix that is the inverse of 'x'
